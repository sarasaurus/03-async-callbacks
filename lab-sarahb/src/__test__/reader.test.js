// File Reader Module Tests
// Use describe and it (or test) methods to define descriptive tests and increase readability
// Each it callback should aim to test a small, well defined, feature of a function
// Write tests to ensure that the reader function rejects errors with invalid file paths
// Write tests to ensure that the reader function correctly resolves mapped string data for an array of file paths
